Luaunit is a testing framework for Lua, in the spirit of Extream Programming.

Luaunit is derived from the initial work of Ryu Gwang but has evolved a lot
from the original code as my understanding of lua progressed.

Luaunit is used extensively in yzis (www.yzis.org), a vi clone, in order to
test the lua binding of the editor.
